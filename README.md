2. [Programs](https://github.com/AnureetKaurTiwana/Business-Analytics_Python_Assignments/blob/main/Python_Assignment_2.ipynb)
   
   nth Fibonacci number
   
   Check if given numb is the fibonacci number
   
   program to print ascii value of a character
   
   sum of squares of first n natural numbers & largest element in array
   
   Largest number using insertion Sort
4. [RegEx Assignment](https://github.com/AnureetKaurTiwana/Business-Analytics_Python_Assignments/blob/main/Assigment17-RegEx.py)

    A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.
    RegEx can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.
3. [Sorting Methods](https://github.com/AnureetKaurTiwana/Business-Analytics_Python_Assignments/blob/main/BubbleSort-HeapSort-SelectionSort-QuickSort.py)
    
    a) Insertion Sort
    
    b) Bubble Sort
    
    c) QuickSort
    
    d) Selection Sort
       Algorithm the minimum value and put it at the start 
       Two for loops are involved, 
       Time complexity is O(n^2)
       Space Complexitt is O(1)
    
    e) Bubble Sort 
        It is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.--Its time complexity is O(n^2)
    
    f)  Merge Sort 
         It is divide and conquer rule
         Time Complexity is O(n log(n))
    
    g) Heap Sort
